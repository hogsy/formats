# Outrage Games

## Descent 3 Engine

Actual name is unknown.

## Rubu Engine

Actual name is unknown.
Borrows a _little_ bit from Descent 3, but not much (at least judging by what we have).

Was originally being used for Rubu Tribes, but ended up getting used for [Alter Echo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_Echo) instead, which was the last game they produced before closing shop.
