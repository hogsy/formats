Much of this is in relation to Wild Water Adrenaline...

All the meat is under the `DATA.BIN` file, which is essentially a package of sorts.

Nothing particularly unusual about the package format itself. There's a table of contents at the start listing out all the files within.

1844 bytes between last entry to first blob...
6144 is first file (2048 * 3 (3 being int before length))
4280 is size of the table...
Each entry is 20 bytes...

Soooo in summary...

struct Index
{
	char name[ 12 ];
	uint32_t blockNum;
	uint32_t size;
};

struct Header
{
	char ident[ 8 ];
	int32_t unk0[ 2 ]; // <- these are 0, so I've no idea
	uint32_t numFiles;
	Index indices[numFiles];
};

Curiously, there are a collection of strings in here that look like symbol names which indicate the title was written in C++, though more interestingly we can see quite a few that seem to relate to features that obviously would not make sense for this game, such as `mTeamSoldierLifeCycle`, `mTeamSoldierFlee`, `mNeedToFlee`, a number of names relating to hand guns, `BULLET_IMPACT_NEAR`, `GUNSHOTS_NOISE`, `UNDER_ATTACK`, `NEED_TO_INSPECT`, `mInventory`, `mAssaultGun`, `worm_start_biting`, `worm_end_biting`, references to Cutter, and uh, many others! I'll try and go over most of these later.

All of the above are from NAMES.BIN - otherwise nothing else to it...all these strings are likely just old left-overs from Outcast 2 but none of it actually remains afaik.

Seems quite a large portion of the game logic is actually implemented in Lua.

Mountain Bike Adrenaline on PC seems to store files in a different way so we can't easily do anything with that yet.
Haven't checked the PS2 version yet, but I'd assume it's the same as this other game.

Rebuilt PS2 ISO with the following...
    mkisofs -udf -o WILDMOD.ISO ./Wild\ Water/

Starting it up with our repacked BIN doesn't work...
There is no checksum on DATA.BIN, so that's not a problem...
Noted it's also padded at the end, that's fixed but still doesn't work... *sigh*
Repacking with the original order of the files retained worked!
Then tried editing a script, saving that and packing - game didn't load... autoexec.lua
Maybe there's a checksum on the autoexec.lua file?
Nope, changing 'English' to 'Butt' worked fine...
But changing it to 'ButtButtButt' did not work, file size increased marginally. Maybe there's a fixed size it loads the files into?? urgh

It's explicitly mentioned here how the game uses Outcast II assets, which is neat.

Contrary to my original thoughts, lighting is actually baked into vertices as colour information rather than a lightmap as I'd originally expected. This makes sense given the target for the PS2.
