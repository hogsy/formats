# Reversed Format Collection

This repository is filled with various notes on various different formats that I've reversed overtime. A lot of these
are provided in [Rehex](https://github.com/solemnwarning/rehex)'s [Binary Template](https://solemnwarning.net/rehex/manual/bt.html) format,
which is easily translatable into C/C++ and most other languages.

If you find anything here useful, please consider [sponsoring me;](https://github.com/sponsors/hogsy)
otherwise a reference or callout wouldn't hurt!

UK-based developer that shut down in 2013.
Developed a number of different games, some of which do seem to share common technology.

### BlitzTech 1

Saturn era, starting with Glover.

- Glover (1998)
- Action Man: Operation Extreme (1999)
- Action Man: Destruction X (2000)
- Frogger 2: Swampy's Revenge (2000)
- Titan A.E. (Demo, 2000) (Cancelled)

## [BottleRocket Entertainment, Inc.](https://www.mobygames.com/company/6986/bottlerocket-entertainment-inc/)

### The Mark of Kri Engine

#### Games

- [The Mark of Kri](https://www.mobygames.com/game/7648/the-mark-of-kri/) (2002) (Sony PlayStation 2)
- [Rise of the Kasai](https://www.mobygames.com/game/21289/rise-of-the-kasai/) (2005) (Sony PlayStation 2)
- [Xiaolin Showdown](https://www.mobygames.com/game/26311/xiaolin-showdown/) (2006) (Sony PlayStation 2, Sony PSP, Microsoft Xbox)

#### Fun Facts

- Package format uses the extension '.WAD'.
- It uses a fairly simple scripting language, which seemed to fall out of use after the first game.

## [Creative Reality](https://www.mobygames.com/company/creative-reality)

### Martian Gothic Engine (PC)

Unfortunately only used for one game, which, you guessed it,
was [Martian Gothic: Unification](https://www.mobygames.com/game/martian-gothic-unification).

#### Fun Facts
- Excluding the `QMDX.dll`, which isn't theirs, the oldest file in the PC version is from August 1998.
- According to MobyGames, this was the last title Creative Reality would produce.
- They appear to have made a mistake with the application icon; the largest size has the smaller icon overlaid on top.
- PlayStation port was handled by Coyote Developments Ltd., which [went into administration in 2006](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/03657440/filing-history?page=2).
- Some of the textures are appended with 'tiff' which may suggest they used it as an intermediate format before conversion.

## [Core Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Core_Design)

![Core Design logo](templates/core/core_logo.png)

### Tomb Raider Engine (1996 - 2000)

### Project Eden Engine (2001)

Unaware of any proper name for this particular engine.

#### Description
The engine was developed from scratch with a next-gen mindset that went away from the grid-based logic of Tomb Raider games.
On the graphics side, the PC version included features like normal mapping, environment mapping, variable-rate animations
and real-time morphing, which all used Direct3D 8.0a's fixed-function pipeline.
On the sound side, the most important feature was real-time environment-aware sound effects using DirectSound 8 and EAX 1.0.

#### Fun Facts
- The game uses the GameSpy SDK for multi-player.
- The game was statically linked with `engine_pc.lib` on PC and `engine_ps2.lib` on PS2.
- PlayStation 2 version of the game was botched. It doesn't even use the integrated hardware vector units.
- Some of the internal texture metadata uses the 'tga' extension which may suggest they used it as an intermediate format before conversion.
- An official level editor was planned, but never released due to poor sales.

### Herdy Gerdy Engine (2002)

Unaware of any proper name for this particular engine.
There is some cross-over between this and the engine developed for the cancelled Tomb Raider Anniversary.

#### Games

## [Tate Interactive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tate_Multimedia)

![Tate logo](templates/tate/tate_logo.png)

Polish company primarily known for producing [Kao the Kangaroo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kao_the_Kangaroo_(2000_video_game)).
Seems that the engine they developed ended up getting used for a number of different games and ported to a number of
different platforms.

### Denis Engine

Listing this separately for now as it seems quite different to the tech used in their later titles.
Name was picked based on the code path indicated by strings in Penguin Kelvin, specifically, `C:\coders\denis\denis\`.

#### Games

Only confirmed titles are here.
Confirmation is performed by finding matching/similar formats, and matching/similar class names and strings in the
executable.

### Tate/Elephant Engine

As usual, I've decided to use this name to identify the technology but otherwise can't find any official name or term
used for the engine. There is a config file in a few titles named 'elephant', which happens to align with their logo
and who knows, might have served as an internal name for the engine.

- [I Love Horses: Rider's Paradise](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/wii/643133-i-love-horses-riders-paradise)
  - Nintendo Wii, 2011

#### Fun Facts
- [I Love Horses: Rider's Paradise](https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/wii/643133-i-love-horses-riders-paradise), 
which is attributed as a Destineer title, appears to use this engine. 
It may have originally been intended as a sequel to 
[My Horse & Me 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Horse_%26_Me_2).
